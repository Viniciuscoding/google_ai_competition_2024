       "2. **Age Rating:** R. Due to the pervasive use of offensive language.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Toxicity:** The repeated use of \"bitch\" directed towards female partners is a clear example of toxic and misogynistic language. The aggressive tone in the conversations also contributes to the toxicity.\n",

       "4. **Fake News:** Not applicable. This appears to be a fictional comedic sketch, not intended to portray real events.\n"
